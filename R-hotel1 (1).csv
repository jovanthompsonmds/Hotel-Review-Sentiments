Hotel,Reviews
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We booked this hostel because it was the cheapest place in the Center area in boston. When we got there there was a mixup with our reservation and they took care of it right away. Excellent customer service at the front desk, very polite and helpful, answered all our questions. The room was a twin on the sixth floor, very... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Good place to stay for a few days. Clean rooms, helping staff and clean bathrooms. The common area is nice and fun with a pool table and a small cinema room. Its the best you can get in Boston for this price. Good place as well. Might not fit a family but would be great if you are coming with... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,Buena localizaciï¿½ï¿½n
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The location is perfect for getting to all of the sections and access to subway stops. Easy to figure out and navigate from Berkley location. One must assume that you won't have all the luxury amenities as the Courtyard Marriott. Taking this into consideration my negative points were was the quality of the beds, the pillow was the worst I... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,I was traveling for work and there was an issue at our hotel so I scrambled for an alternative solution and found 40 Berkeley. The lobby was clean and comfortable and the staff was friendly. I liked that bed linens and towels were included in the room price so I didn't have to pack these. The rooms are very bare... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We arrived to Boston on Amtrak late (11pm) and hustled a car to the hostel. We were quickly checked in and put in a larger room as the 2 bed unit we reserved was unavailable. The room was sparse but provided the beds we needed and a mini fridge as a bonus. With no A/C, we used the provided fans... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Spent 3 nights here in July and was pretty much as expected - basic accommodation (with wardrobe, double bed, no A/C, shared restrooms), decent communal facilities (big lounge, TV room, free wi-fi, elevators, water fountains, etc). The hotel/hostel is situated within 1-2 kilometres of all the things you might want to do see - shops, restaurants, local points of... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The lobby is nicer than the rooms, which are very basic. The shared bathrooms are also pretty old-fashioned. It's fine if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills. Free coffee 7am-5pm."
40 Berkeley Hostel,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ Excellent place to stay. Good Location and very nice staff.
40 Berkeley Hostel,Paula audited the room's inhabitants when coming in after getting dinner.  I have never been grilled so hard upon trying to just go inside and get a night of sleep.  No A/C is brutally hot.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"40 is very comfortable and have a good location to go by foot to many interesting points in Boston. Nice rooms, and a very warm and festive atmosphere. The bathroom is shared, so it gives the illusion of being in a student dorm which is part of the charm. The lobby is very nice place to be. Good internet access.... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"A hostel, not a hotel. Located in an old building with original style. Staff was nice and rooms were clean. However, given shared bathrooms, rooms being furnished only very basically and breakfast was not available, the price was very high. Also we had a fire alarm during night twice and in general it was bit noisy (due to the street... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,This hostel hotel seems really good for its value. Well refurbished. Warm. Spotless. Lots of self service facilities and communal spaces. Friendly and very helpful staff. About a third of the cost of any formal hotels near by. I really cannot understand the so negative reviews unless it was a reflection about how expensive Boston is. Deserves it's lonely planet... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Hello, just got back from another stay at the Berkeley Boston. still great staff, affordable, obviously great location. Our 3rd stay was only disappointed that no breakfast was served.Previously a wonderful cafeteria was open for buffet breakfast with all you could need. I realize this is a great expense, however it did go from all to almost nothing! Coffee/tea provided.... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,They are not serving breakfast anymore. A big bummer for me as I was hoping to save some expenses on breakfast. My room can be too warm from the heater and I need to open the windows during the day and night to keep the room cool. I am from Singapore so I am not a big fan of too... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Firstly, you must know that this is a hostel and by no means is a hotel suitable for families or older couples. Like many others we decided to take a chance based purely on the affordable price. I certainly have no bad feelings against this hostel as I believe they probably provide a very good service as a low income... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I was only here for 2 nights but I really enjoyed my stay and thought I got a great deal for my money! It's in a great location as your aren't far from anything, fenway, sports bars, restaurants, the station, park and the waterfront to name a few. I stayed in a twin room with a shared bathroom. The rooms... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"One of the cheapest places to stay at in the city for a weekend. It is a hostel, so obviously it's not the most beautiful and accommodating place to stay, but I will say it was a lot better than what I thought it would be. We stayed on a relatively warm weekend, so being without AC wasn't as bad... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The reason we chose to stay at 40 Berkeley was for the convenient location (2 blocks from the orange subway line and 30 minute walk to the Boston Common/downtown area) and reasonable price compared to other hotels and hostels in Boston (130/night for room with double bed and shared bathroom). The positive: The location served us well, as we were... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"My husband and I stayed here for two nights in June. Although I did find it a little expensive for what it was (180 / night), this was one of the least expensive options we could find for staying in Downtown Boston. The rooms were standard, but clean. As many travellers have indicated, the building is dated, so many rooms... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"For the price payed, this hostel is located near a T stop(5 minutes walk) which gives you acces to all the city. Very affordable compared to the hotels downtown. Be sure to ask for a newly renovated room. We got a renovated room(2nd floor, 1full bed). Bed was comfy and room was clean. Lobby staff was welcoming and nice. Would... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This basic spot is definitely worth it if you're travelling on a budget. The place Is large and has a very safe and friendly feel to it. The staff have good local knowledge and are more than happy to spend time with you to explain which sights to see, where to eat and how to get around. It's spotless and... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,This was converted to a budget hotel with no sign of any investment to justify the prices. Beat up furniture in the room. Filthy hall carpets. Shared single sex bathrooms. No air conditioning. Super slow internet. I don't know if the Y is still involved. Someone is making a good profit.
40 Berkeley Hostel,You get what you pay for! It was fine for a stop over it was clean but basic! Rooms are small and quite warm. The staff were all very friendly and helped us plan our trip and we felt our things were safe in our rooms.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Muy lindo el lugar, el personal muy buena onda."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The first surprise was that the rooms do not have their own bathrooms. Be prepared to wander the halls of this place in your towel, and see others doing the same. The shared shower on my floor did not work, so I ended up walking down to another floor to shower. Also, there is no food at all in the... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"When we booked we thought it was a cheap hotel, with shared bath and toilet, but it is not a hotel, it is too basic with no tv in room, no aircon, or other things you expect in a hotel. Then we thought it was a hostel, but it is not that either, since the kitchen facilities are limited to... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,Quiet hours are after 10pm
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I really want to like this place but I just couldn't. So, the service we got on check in was great! He was really helpful. Told us when we checked out that they could store our bags and we could hang around if we needed to both after checkout and before- since we arrived a couple of hrs before check... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"All in all a good and clean hostel. The rooms provided enough space. The sanitaries were clean for hostel standarts. Unfortunately we had a room with a very loud, clattering air conditioning below which wasn't that good for sleeping."
40 Berkeley Hostel,The hotel is centrally located close to the Bay Village Boston Common. Overall I was not disappointed by this hotel. We felt safe and close to everything we wanted to see. If you are lucky you might get a room with a great view like we did. Pros: Relatively cheap hotel 130 per night vs the 350 average in... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,Stay here.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Paula was extremely friendly. Helped me and my friend find food at 3 in the morning after coming home from the bars. Overall a decent, cheap place that provided the basic necessities."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The hostel is cool and offers good services such as pool tables, cinema rooms and a large lounge. However one of the two showers of my floor was broken and the corridors stink a little bit."
40 Berkeley Hostel,I was booked in this hostel for two nights. Room was so so and the bed was rough (well I did not expect anything good from it). I had a long day and found out I could not sleep well every night because of this. The bathroom was so far away from my room. The guy at the reception was... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"My second time staying there, the location is great. But looks like is more like a nurse home, or I can't even describe, my last time staying there was just couple weeks ago, and not even breakfast they offer anymore. When u pay US 100.00 plus tax to be in a hostel where u have to share bathrooms u expect... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Horrible experience at 40 Berkeley. The room was not clean, sheets severely stained and mattress in a plastic cover. The shared bathroom facilities were also very dirty and messy and did not seem to be cleaned on a regular basis. Due to no A.C. the room was incredibly hot. Although we had a ceiling fan which helped marginally, it was... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Cheap as far as boston in concerned. Clean, good location, helpful staff. The heater wouldnt turn off though which was extreemly annoying. They gave us direction which we followed but it would not turn off. Bed was ok."
40 Berkeley Hostel,A good place to stay if you don't mind going down the hall for a bathroom. Definitely a 'student housing/hostel' type place but it's in a great neighborhood easy to get to from Back Bay T. Rooms very basic no AC.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Had to stay overnight in Boston, because of flight schedule. Hotels were sold out or over 300 a nite, so we tried 40 Berkeley. This was our first hostel experience and other than no air and just a ceiling fan in hot weather, it went well. The room was clean, comfortable bed and soft sheets, and bathroom convenient and clean.... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We had one night here. It was beyond our expectations. Very cosy atmosphere, spacious room, good service, clean overall, nice garden. Good location! A hidden gem in the city :-) We will recommend it for everyone and will absolut stay here another time in Boston."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"All in whole it was a great hostel! Very clean, which was important for us. Very nice facilities and quite central (about 15 Min walk to the very center). Also the staff is helpful and friendly. The only thing is that our room was quite old (the furniture and so on). But besides that: it's a great place to stay."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Unfortunately I have to say that the staff was not very motivated and not helpful at all. When booking my stay, I asked for advice about parking as I was bringing a car. I never got an answer to that question. Two my email 3 days before my stay I also got no answer. Finally on the day of my... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We stayed here for 3 nights in early august. I did not book this myself, but a hostel on itself isn't always that bad. We got a bit dissapointed though. I'll start with the positive things: the hostel is located close (5 mins walk) a large subway station, staff is VERY friendly and wifi (yet slow) is provided everywhere as... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,great trip help at the hotel was great the workers answers all our questions all it needs new beds close to buses trains subways. it is in a great location to see the city of boston . The only things it needs is new mattress
40 Berkeley Hostel,"One of my friend recommended me to stay in this hostel. And here I am, when I first checked in, I love their spacious lobby area. They have many comfortable white couch around. They also provide the guest with common room, where you can chit-chat with other guest, play pool, watch movies, and get a snack from vending machine. For... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Best way to make a reservation is directly on the 40Berkeley website rather than a 'third party' such as hostel-bookers which works out cheaper and more reliable. Rooms are very basic (bed, desk and storage space) with shared communal bathrooms. Helpful friendly staff on hand 24 hours. Free WiFi available, but no longer serves breakfast. Basic recreation room, coffee machine... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"It is clean and well enough located, close to train/metro lines and if you know which direction there are a couple of quite restaurants near by. The staff though may not know about them... make sure you consult google / yelp to find out what is around. WiFi is free, which is a great plus. There is a water station... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Price value is not true, not clean, here is exploited, that there is no comparably priced accommodations in Boston! You sleeping on old camping beds with innerspring. Everything seemed dingy except the entrance area."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This property is a little dated. it is after all a hostel so you get what you pay for. They do have some convenient features: pool tables, wifi, water filling station, and a wonderful outdoor lounging area. Rooms are average, but the shared bathrooms are pretty good. Many things in need of an update, but location is good."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Went there for one night with friends and we booked a 4 bedroom's room for ourself. The location of the hostel is good and at the reception the stuff was fairly nice. However, the bedrooms are extremely basic and not very clean. Moreover, at night it gets extremely noisy and incredibly hot (the room had no air conditioning). Had difficulty... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,So it's cheap and clean enough. The bathrooms are nicely remodeled. Our room felt very dorm-y and cold. They don't serve breakfast anymore. I literally think this place is half hostel/half nursing home. Very weird vibe in this place. I felt safe and it's waking distance to a lot of cool spots. But if you're a fan of hostels and... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The location is excellent. Back Bay is a very nice area and the hostel is close to the T station. The staff was always nice and helpful and our room was clean. It was pretty loud at night and early in the morning because our room was facing the street, but we still managed to sleep well most of the... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Arrived just before midnight from Australia, and were greated with smiles. Small double room, great bed, totally clean,, bathroom across the hall. Close to everything including coffee and restaruants plus plus plus. Just being in the lobby and the garden is nice.We will go again."
40 Berkeley Hostel,Do not even try to eat the breakfast. Start your day right by finding something outside.
40 Berkeley Hostel,I stayed for a week at 40 Berkeley as I have to attend conference at Harvard. The room is reasonable. The breakfast is very good for a hostel. The subway is 5 mins walking distance. The chinatown is 2 stops away. Helpful staff.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Room was cold, pillow sucked. Jack hammers and traffic on the street could be heard around the clock. Cleaners were steam cleaning carpets early in the morning which was so loud I couldn't sleep. Front desk staff were on their phones or talking amongst themselves rather than engaging with customers."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Really recommend this hostel. Good amenities, nice staff. Neighbourhood is quiet and cute. Rooms are basic but clean. Affordable rates."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This is a basic hostel, not a hotel. Therefore we knew when we booked it what we would be getting ourselves into. The reason we chose to stay at 40 Berkley was due to the fact all other hotels were either booked up or exorbitantly over priced. The room we a private room which a shared bathroom. The set up... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I never fail to be shocked by the cost of staying in Boston, but the Berkeley Hostel was a nice find. I needed a spot for one night on my way through town and thats exactly what this provided. Expensive for a hostel, but when compared with other spots in Boston I guess its comparable. The room was simple and... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,If you don't like the food down stairs they ALWAYS have burgers that they will cook to order just ask. It takes about 10-15 minutes though
40 Berkeley Hostel,"It's a hostel so we were not expecting much and that's what we got. Six days was a bit much to deal with a not great mattress and sub par water pressure in the shower. The location is great, walking distance to lots of great restaurants, bars and sights. Also close to transit. If we were to go back it... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,Very nice place!
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We arrived at 40 Berkeley in the middle of October for a one night stay. We had seen it advertised on Hostelworld as a trendy hostel in a trendy area and given the 138 price tag for a shared bathroom room, were expecting more. Check in staff were good, although the first thing that struck us was the number of... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The less you stay here, the more you'll like it. In fact, you might just use that as incentive for getting out and sightseeing in Boston...not that you need any outside encouragement. But if you think you'll walk the dogs and hit the hay for a nice siesta, I'd tell my best friend/family member to downscale those modest expectations. My... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Excellent localization. Well maintained bathrooms and clean bed sheets and towels. Good accommodation. Staff very kind. Best cost benefit!! Next time in Boston, it's gonna be our choice of booking...."
40 Berkeley Hostel,I booked about 4 weeks in advance and a single room with shared bathroom took about 100 USD/night. Good price for the location pretty bad considering the quality of the room and the level of cleanliness - I have seen overcrowded youth hostels with similar standards for 1/3 of the price. Overall pretty sad...
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We usually stay in hotels, but I couldn't find anything in our price range in Boston so we chose 40 Berkeley. It was our first time staying at a hostel so we were a bit nervous. The location of 40 Berkeley is really good. We stayed in a double room with a shared bathroom. The room was very plain, just... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Pros: Cost - hotel cost in Boston is outrageous so compared to those prices, the cost is OK but still far too much for what you get Location- is excellent. Not far to boston common/ freedom trail. Very cheap to get an uber to Little Italy/ Harvard Cons: We had a private double room with shared bathroom. I have stayed... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This is a hostel so you basically you're getting what you pay for. Pros: Compared to other places, this is a good option if you're on a budget. The location was nice as it was within walking distance of the subway, parks, restaurants and a convenience store was across the road. They also have a pool table, movie room, laundry,... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,The wireless sucks here. Keeps cutting me off. Don't get frustrated - use a nearby Starbucks instead.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"So yeah, this place may be close to what you want to see in Boston, but Christ you wont want to see the rooms! Yes it's a hostel and the bathrooms are shared, I get that, but for what you get in the room, no AC....REALLY! It's just not worth the money. We are in Boston for 3 nights (just... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This is a hostel and not a hotel! With prices being very high in Boston, you get what you pay for here. Room is very basic, double bed very small, no air con just a ceiling fan , a very thin window and no safety deposit box so be sure to take your valubles out with you! Front desk staff... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Hostel style - shared bathrooms, pretty clean. Good reception and staff. Plenty of communal areas. Convenient location. Great laundry facilities. Parking is an issue but they have arrangements for reasonably affordable parking about 10 mins walk away! Wifi signal is a bit intermittent. Main downfall is lack of self catering facilities. Not really any refrigeration available, no breakfast and very... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"More than worth it. Hotel prices for the weekend in this area were around 400 a night, and I paid 188 for a full size bed private room w shared bathroom. The bathroom is basic, like a dorm, would be nice to have a bench or somewhere to put clothes and stuff while showering, but functional. The housekeeping service was... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,My boyfriend and I travelled to Boston to see the red sox. It was our first visit to Boston and it will not be our last. the hostel offered free wifi and rooms at a great rate compared to the expensive hotels that concur downtown boston. we ended up going during pride which was cool. The hostel offered a pool... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,Here are the bad points: beds are small and uncomfortable the place is generally noisy being a hostel there appear to be many permanent local residents roaming the place which makes it a bit odd my room was on the top floor and when I complained about noisy mechanical equipment on the roof running all night and making it impossible... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I reserved for 6 nights because I was on a budget. After the first night I cancelled everything and moved elsewhere. I prefer to pay double what I payed here. The rooms are the same as a prison cell and the place seems like the perfect sceanery for a horror movie, there are old ladys literally roaming the halls.... good... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,The location is quite good. But the room for three was small and not very comfortable. No AC and it was very hot. The common bathrooms are clean. Good for people who don't care about their comfort and are on a tight budget.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Stayed here for one night while visiting Boston. I made a late online reservation, but I got a room with 2 twin beds with shared bathrrom for about 150. I think that's a good price for the start of October, and it's just a 15 minute walk to get to downtown Boston from the hostel. The room is quite basic,... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I stayed here to save some money, but it might have been worth it to pay a bit extra for something nicer. Decent location close to a Hubway bikeshare station and walking distance to the Metro. For a hostel, it was surprisingly quiet. The rooms are clean but very spartan and look like university dorms. The bed is a thin... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I would not recommend staying here during the summer time. There was no air conditioning in any of the rooms, and when I asked about a fan, the person at the front desk told me there is one in the closet, which there wasn't. Walking into the hotel, another family staying there identified the hotel as the sweat shop, and... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,I have stayed at 40 Berkeley on a number of visits to Boston and have enjoyed its good location and reasonable room rate. On this trip I was disappointed to see that while the rooms are now painted brighter colours the property was below standard in so many areas. The same shower cubicle on the second floor was still out... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Wi-fi is really good, and the food was nice. Really nice staff. Cool other stuff to enjoy while in the hotel, too. Activities, movie room, etc. Nice, overall."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Great choice, wonderful location!"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"It was my first hostel, and has been better than expected. We were in 4 and stayed for 2 periods. In the firts we got a bedroom with 2 bunks, very limited space! Second time we got a 4 twin beds bedroom, much better! The bathroom are not gorgeous, but are fine. Recepcionists were very helpful. WiFi is fine too!!"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I recomennedne this place, 5 stars from me. Everything from stuffs to food were good!! We""ll back here :)"
40 Berkeley Hostel,If you just make a little conversation with Paula then she isn't that bad.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"OK, the prices of hotels in Boston are completely outrageous. We were staying for three nights, and for that period 40 Berkeley was fine. There were no rooms with double beds available, so we had two twins that couldn't even be pushed together because they were different heights. Bathrooms were down the hall. No air conditioning. These things I could... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The hostel is located in a very good place. Quick check-in. The service was average. We got a room on the first floor. Clean, tidy, basic features. The hostel worked free WiFi. Shared bathroom in mind. Breakfast in the restaurant opposite, very mediocre. Hostel can be recommended."
40 Berkeley Hostel,Pretty decent place for the price. Wifi was dodgy from the 3rd floor and the pipes are loud. Rooms don't have lockers.
40 Berkeley Hostel,Isabel habla castellano! Muy buen lugar para alojar. Es un barrio tranquilo cerca de estaciones de metro.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Stay in a suite in this hostel, staff great, cleaniless awesome and location great. Stay here for the 4 of july. Best price in the area. 30 min walking distances to fenway park or 12 min in bike. No parking have to park 4 blocks away. A convinience store 24hr is locate it right in front of the hotel. Restaurants... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"40 Berkeley is a perfect location for people wanting to sightsee and go into the city a lot. The location simply could not be better. The train station is right across the street from the hostel, and just a couple of stops from the hot spots. The hostel is also in a beautiful neighborhood, which we walked through often, just... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The room was simple, like a dorm room, but that was what I was expecting. The building was clean and quiet and there were some nice amenities like a laundry room, a mini movie theater, and free popcorn (although they only seem to make it once a day and it would usually run out by the time I was returning... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,My son and I stayed for 2 days. Very basic but it was good enough for us. We just slept and shower it was good enough. Great location walking distance to everything close enough to the T . ( Subway). Only one thing there was the lobby / coffee station was not very clean.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"40 Berkeley is a very good option in Boston's overpriced hotel market. It has spartan but clean rooms, sparkling shared bathrooms, a coffee and microwave station for guests, and a large screen TV common room. The staff is friendly and helpful. Great location for seeing Boston, with a small market across the street and a subway stop just a few... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I spent three nights at Berkeley 40, Boston, and well, I guess if I would have known what it was like, I would have spent some more money for a better place. I was sleeping in a single room with a shared bathroom. The room was clean, but the bed was awful. I'm not a heavy person, but I could... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"A nice place for a short stay. We spend a night at this hostel. Better for young travellers. The asian guy at the reception was very kind and helpfull. Our room was moderate, clean and had a free wi-fi. back bay metro station is just a few minutes away where you can go to most of the touristic places in... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,The room was small with two small beds. It looked really unfriendly. The worst thing was bathroom - an old one and not that clean. There were only two bathroom per floor for about 15 rooms. Only three showers for women and the one bathroom for men per floor. The floor corridores were quite dirty. Whole hotel interiors need a... More
40 Berkeley Hostel,"This is a cheap hotel, not a hostel. The only good thing was the free popcorn at night. There was no breakfast, pretty much no kitchen, there was only a microwave and toaster. They could not even offer you a mug for coffee or a plate/fork. The desk will give you plastic cutlery-no recycling bins either. Room and bathrooms are... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I stayed in Berkeley 40 just for one day and although I really wanted to write a great review unfortunately I cannot do it. First the good things: The desk staff was super friendly and helpful, I cannot say enough positive things about them. The location is superb, 8 minutes walk to Cobley Plaza. My room has a big window,... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The staff here were brilliant - so attentive and friendly - they were more than happy to assist with any queries. The place seems to be partially used as a shelter or temporary accommodation so there are people living there semi-permanently, which isn't made clear when you book. It was incredibly noisy and difficult to get a good nights sleeps... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,Avoid Paula at all costs
40 Berkeley Hostel,"As an American, hosteling is a bit intimidating. Personal space and privacy are a big deal. But after one look at hotel prices in Boston, I ran away screaming. Why is everything on the East Coast so expensive Well, not 40 Berkeley. Staying here was the best choice! The hostel front desk was especially helpful, and the private room I... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"my room mate and I did not make use of the movie room or free coffee simply because we were not in the hostel all that much, but we did take nights to study in the many spots available. although i have stayed at hostels in Asia that were much nicer this one was great for its location and price.... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I love this place - clean, cheap, and in the center of town. One note: they no longer offer a complimentary breakfast. You can't beat the prices, and the staff are professional and friendly. Free wife abounds, and there's ample space to work."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We stayed for 3 nights. Rooms are very basic, and without air conditioning it was pretty warm in the room. But for the price we expected and tolerated that. Shared bathrooms were find and regularly cleaned. Free wifi was a godsend. All in all just what I expected for a traveller type hostel."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Don't let the fact that this is a hostel, it is good ,clean, affordable accomodation in the trendy Back Bay area. If you take the communal shower option they are spotlessly clean and well maintained. It is within a short walk from Back Bay station and Copley Square. The staff are great and very helpful. there is a small 7/11... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,walking distance to historic area and attractions. only reason that you want this place is budget. no air-condition and small room but it is expensive to stay in hotels in Boston. It is college dormitory style.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Overall a very good hostel with free wifi and walkable distance to Boston downtown. Was disappointed that there was no air conditioning, especially for the hot summer days in Boston. Facilities are excellent through, with free coffee and popcorn, pool tables, a cinema, a reading area, etc. Only real problem I had during the stay is that the beds are... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The cost of the hostel was perfect for what we needed on a holiday weekend. The bathrooms were clean and working and the room was big compared to other hostels I have stayed at. They also had shower towels, and bedding / pillows whereas other hostels do not always provide these free of charge. The common area is great! They... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The location of 40 Berkeley is great, subways are easy to reach and the surrounding area in general is rather high class and quiet. The hotel itself is welcoming, the staff friendly and helpful, the room however was quite small and the bathrooms are... bearable. Two showers and toilets shared per floor, overall condition is rather old and I would... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Considering the prices in Boston, this us the cheapest offer you can find and the location is very good. But this is no hotel. This is a youth hostel and should be categorized as one. I didn't mind the shared bathrooms and the minimalism in the rooms but common, a little investment in the place won't kill your business. The... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"We stayed here for 5 nights and really enjoyed it here, it it very close to the subway line and only about a 30 minute walk to Boston center. It was well worth the money, the staff were not overly friendly but very accommodating. The communal areas were extensive and kept well maintained and the rooms were clean. They were... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Alright. This is a HOSTEL not a hotel but still. All say this though.. It was definitely clean, no bed bugs. If you frequent hostels and don't have a problem with that kind of standard, you'll probably be fine with this place. However, all of us that stay at regular hotels and I'm NOT talking about any luxury. Hotels like... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"40 Berkeley has a great location and all of the staff members are very friendly. My single room was very clean and offered plenty of drawer and hanger space, along with a small table. Perfect for those on the budget in boston. It would be nice though if they cleaned the shared bathrooms/showers more often...by the end of the day... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I'd never stayed at 40Berkeley until this March and I was very pleased with the professionalism of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms, bathrooms and facility in general. My room was spartan - but since all I wanted was a bed and a place to hang my clothes, this was perfect. I liked that the guest population was... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Could have done with another shower or two on each floor. Couldn't figure out how to turn off the radiator in the bedroom hence room was boiling! Beds were comfortable, free tea coffee and popcorn was great. Lots of nice communal areas but as there is no kitchen area it was hard to meet other travellers. Great location, could walk... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I booked this hostel after having a hard time finding affordable rentals for Boston Marathon weekend. This ended up being a great option and within walking distance of so much. It was a prefect location.There is nothing super spectatular about the accommodations (basics and it's an old building), but the people working there are friendly and nice and everything worked...

40 Berkeley Hostel,"This place is awful: for that price, we expected a nice hostel (it has 2 stars)... but it rather looks like a social center (homeless and old people in pyjamas were wandering around in the filthy hall), don't trust the pictures! It's old, dirty, no AC (in August!!), very noisy (inside outside) and the staff is absolutely unconcerned (didn't... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,- Excellent location - basic but clean rooms - free coffee in the morning and a small free movie room (cinema-style) - very friendly staff - conclusion: good choice for budget travelers who want to be in Boston's city centre
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Cheap accommodation in the heart of Boston. Things are a little run-down, but the price is very reasonable considering the location. Free popcorn after 2pm everyday!"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Great location in Boston, easily accessible by highway, public transit. Dorm style. Downside is no air condition. Inexpensive and good value. Bathroom was clean and orderly. Bed was comfortable. Stayed in a private double."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"The hostel was easy to find. Located in the Back Bay area, just a few blocks from Trinity Square. The staff was very polite and helpful. The building looks quite old. The rooms are not really modern but for the budget absolutely okay. Bed could have been more comfortable. Shared bathrooms' cleanliness was acceptable: while sinks toilets were clean... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Based on the fact we wanted a cheap room, we got that. At this point it's all depends on your interpretation of what a 175.00 US room in central Boston valued. I'm disapointed because the room was advertise 4 twin bed, we got 4 single bed instead. Also there was one bed (mine) directly close to the window and it... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"40 Berkley is worth the money you pay! The rooms are simple and easy, but come with all your necessities. The women's bathroom on the 6th floor was very nice, looked newly renovated. However the shower heads were very low, and I am not tall by any means! The free popcorn is a nice touch after a long day exploring.... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Hotel advertises shared bathrooms. I thought that meant 1 bathroom between 2 rooms. Nope. One common bAthroom for the whole floor, on the 2nd floor. There are 2 showers in the bath area, but 1 has been out of order for several weeks. Avoid 2nd floor if you can. Oh don't forget to ask for hand soap, shampoo, and lotion... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"I had a conference to attend in Boston, and the price of the conference hotel rooms was insane. I joked with my co-workers about staying in a hostel instead of at the hotel, but when I found 40B on the internet I decided to actually go for it. I've been to numerous hostels, both in the US and abroad -... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Since my last stay in June 2014, 40 Berkeley has had its kitchen closed down. No breakfast now, but the price still appears to be the same (and obviously the evening meal option has gone). All of Boston accommodation is horrendously expensive by European standards, so if it is just for s night or two, then, yes, do stay here... More"
40 Berkeley Hostel,"Room and restrooms were clean, the staff was helpful. Nevertheless, the room were very simple and the hostel wasn't quiet at all. Due to thin door and window you could hear noise from the coridor and from outside all night. The price was quite high for the service they offer, especially in summer."
40 Berkeley Hostel,paula audited the room's inhabitants when coming in after getting dinner.  i have never been grilled so hard upon trying to just go inside and get a night of sleep.  no a/c is brutally hot.
40 Berkeley Hostel,good for the price. rooms are clean. the restroom is shared.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"muy lindo el lugar, el personal muy buena onda."
40 Berkeley Hostel,avoid paula at all costs

40 Berkeley Hostel,the wireless sucks here. keeps cutting me off. don't get frustrated - use a nearby starbucks instead.
40 Berkeley Hostel,if you just make a little conversation with paula then she isn't that bad.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"the hostel is cool and offers good services such as pool tables, cinema rooms and a large lounge. however one of the two showers of my floor was broken and the corridors stink a little bit."
40 Berkeley Hostel,buena localizaciÃ³n
40 Berkeley Hostel,if you don't like the food down stairs they always have burgers that they will cook to order just ask. it takes about 10-15 minutes though
40 Berkeley Hostel,"wi-fi is really good, and the food was nice. really nice staff. cool other stuff to enjoy while in the hotel, too. activities, movie room, etc. nice, overall."
40 Berkeley Hostel,pretty decent place for the price. wifi was dodgy from the 3rd floor and the pipes are loud. rooms don't have lockers.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"paula was extremely friendly. helped me and my friend find food at 3 in the morning after coming home from the bars. overall a decent, cheap place that provided the basic necessities."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"great choice, wonderful location!"
40 Berkeley Hostel,quiet hours are after 10pm

40 Berkeley Hostel,ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ excellent place to stay. good location and very nice staff.
40 Berkeley Hostel,"good: great value, clean. bad: communal toilets. somewhere between a homeless shelter and an open prison. lobby doesn't match rooms."
40 Berkeley Hostel,"the lobby is nicer than the rooms, which are very basic. the shared bathrooms are also pretty old-fashioned. it's fine if you just need a cheap base for a visit with no frills. free coffee 7am-5pm."

40 Berkeley Hostel,ï‘ excellent place to stay. good location and very nice staff.
40 Berkeley Hostel,not a hostel in the sense of good environment or to meet people. the hostel is basic and fair. well located but in my opinion it's way to expensive considering it's also a transitional shelter!!!
