Hotel,Reviews
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Breakfast was the best, and the best thing about the stay was the one and only host, great conversations at breakfast and advise on the city. Very nice neighborhood. Only reason that it did not get 5 stars is that the room has room for improvement, not any fault of the host. This is bed and breakfast, but not your honeymoon style BB, I would stay here again. Room comfort could improve with a new air conditioning unit, other then that five stars. Sharing the bathroom, never a problem, and coming in and out with you wanted never a problem. No need to rent a car, easy with public transportation."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"A nice BB really close to Harvard Square. A little confusing getting there if your walking (very little to no street signs) but ultimately a call to the BB saved me from wondering around. Quiet neighborhood, bed was comfortable and bathroom was good considering that this is a very old building so keep that in mind. This is not the Marriot but it is a nice place to rest after a long day on a plane. The innkeeper (Byron) was very nice and helpful. I didn't stay for the breakfast opting for a bowl of cereal instead due to a busy schedule. Overall a good BB experience and I would definitely come back if I'm ever in the area. Thank you. A.G."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,A poor excuse for a BB
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"This BB couldn't have been more perfect. Great location. Clean rooms, comfortable beds, courteous staff, and breakfast cooked for you at whatever time you request. They even held our bags after we checked out so we could go to the natural history museum."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,We booked for 6 nights but left after 5. BB is old and shoddy. If you choose this place get some rose colored glasses like the ones used by other reviewers.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Having travelled for 24 hours in total from Ha Noi, Viet Nam to Cambridge, I finally landed in the small but cosy BB late in the evening and was wellcomed by Byron Jordan. He gave me the opportunity to choose the room and advised me which room was less noisy. I immediately felt like I was at home with care... More"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"A Bed Breakfast in Cambridge is a lovely BB set on the 3rd floor of a traditional home. My son I spent 5 days there while exploring the city. - Room: our room felt smallish because we had 2 twin beds, however it was extremely comfortable. In particular the bedding is super nice with down comforters and pillows.... More"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"The host was great. The location is close to Harvard Sq. With plenty of great restaurants around. Parking was on the street, but not too inconvenient."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"The good aspects of this BB are its innkeeper Byron (very helpful, friendly and always available) and its location (10min walking from Harvard's yard and 15min from the Harvard metro station). On the other hand the interior design of the rooms could be better (e.g. it would be better to drop the huge bed size towards something smaller, invest in a more comfortable mattress and more desk space) and it is not convenient to have to share a bathroom."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Clean, comfort and neat. A little worry about the bathroom, because there is only one and no lock, which is shared by at least 4 customers."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Small room. Trash never taken out. Same exact breakfast every single morning for two weeks. Shared bathroom.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"This BB is ideally located in Cambridge, walking distance to shopping, dining, and Harvard. Lovely experience with owners and staff. Travelers should be prepared for 3 flights of stairs (free exercise!) and a shared bathroom. Kitchen is accessible to guests and was a nice feature. Wifi works great. Bed was very comfortable. Staff is a wealth of knowledge and information. I will be staying here again when in town."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Great place to stay for our whole family to participate and watch the Boston Marathon. Close to the Harvard Square subway station able to take the red line straight to the loading and finish area in Boston Commons Karen and Doan are great host with a great breakfast to start your day. The rooms are nice with a very much... More
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,I booked this hotel but looking at the condition I decided to go to another hotel. They did not refund any money and above all we're putting cancellation panelty of additional 200.....bigggggg mistake
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Lesen Sie unsere Berichte Wir haben schon mindestens einmal geschriebe,. grsslich alles. Niemand war da"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. NO DIRECTION. NOBODY TO PICK CALLS NOR REPLY MAILS. NO PROVISION FOR ONLINE PAYMENT .IT WAS A WASTED HARD EARNED MONEY.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"BB:n huoneet (3) ovat vhn nuhjuisen puutalon kolmannessa kerroksessa. Kytvll on jaettu kylpyhuone sek keitti aamiaista varten. Huone oli pienehk ja snky leve, mutta normaalimittaisellekin melko lyhyt. Kadulle olevassa huoneessa voi kuulua liikenteen melua aamulla ja illalla, yll alue oli rauhallinen. Jaettu kylpyhuone oli siisti. Aamiaisen sai sovittua haluamakseen ajaksi seuraavaksi aamuksi. Bostonin alueen hintatasoon suhteutettuna kohtuuhintaista majoitusta, BB:ss kaikki toimi ja hoitui sovitusti. Harvardin kampukselle lyhyt 5 minuutin matka, lhimmlle metroasemalle noin 10 minuuttia. Cambridgen keskustan ravintolat ja palvelut metroaseman lhell."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"It is obvious that Byron's, Karen's and Doane's passion is hospitality. During our stay they listened, facilitated and helped us to find our way in the BB, Cambridge, and the surroundings. We had booked the West-room which is on the back of the house next to the kitchen and in front of the bathroom. The rooms were very clean and... More"

A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Great location, very comfortable, nice plants, delicious breakfast, plus a warm homey feeling. Byron is interesting and we had some great conversations. Would definitely recommend, and would stay there again."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,very cosy place
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Loved my stay in A Bed Breakfast in Cambridge! I felt warmly welcomed and carried for. Lord Byron was very helpful and always a lot of fun! :-)
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"This place was a great, quirky little hotel. Byron the innkeeper was great. His crepes were fantastic. Nice back porch. Perfect weekend cambridge spot!"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,I had a great time here during my stay in September. Byron was very helpful and made sure that our stay was as good as it was. The breakfast was great. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place in Cambridge or Boston area. The public transit is also very good making it easy to get around... More
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"I didn't realize it was a room with shared bath (4 rooms share one bathroom). My room window facing a busy street and was very noisy at night. It was very nice of the owner to allow me to cancel my 2nd night without penalties. The only pleasant of my stay was to meet the inn keeper Byron, who is a very nice person and very informative."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Our host, Byron was very friendly and helpful in all aspects. We had great conversations with him. He cooked healthy breakfast for us, and even helped with our luggage and other info about the neighborhood. If we go back to Cambridge, we will try to stay at this Bed and Breakfast again!"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Very good. Ideal location - just 5 mins walk from Harvard 10 mins to the T. From there, was 15 mins into Park St (Boston Common). Byron the host was very friendly. Breakfast was usually freshly cooked pancakes additional cereal would be nice. Only other thing is that the BB is up 2 flights of stairs - not a problem for me but could be for some."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Everything about the place was above and beyond what I needed and expected it to be. The house is in a great spot, within walking distance of most of Harvard, and close to the Harvard T-station, so easy to get around. Breakfasts were always delicious, as the innkeeper is a wonderful chef. Great food and food for thought in the morning, with many interesting stories and ideas exchanged. Rooms were really nice, and the bed was very comfortable. Shared bathroom was always clean and tidy, and never busy/no waiting for the shower. A/C kept the room cool, temperature was never a problem. Innkeeper was always accommodating and very easy-going. Would definitely stay here again."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"This BB resides in the third floor of an old house. One of the four rooms on the third floor is lived by a staff there, who is nice and helps you with luggage. There is only one bathroom on the third room, which is extremely inconvenient. Most of the time, you have to share the bathroom with other at least four people, take turns and often wait to use the bathroom. The furniture in the room is old with a rotten wood smell. You can smell it all the time. The kitchen looks very dirty. The staff will make the breakfast for you if you are willing to wait there, which can take pretty a long time. Though you can tell the staff when you prefer to have the breakfast, you will feel really embarrassed if you are the only one having the breakfast at the time. In addition, can you imagine a BB not offering orange juice for breakfast The worst part, the price is not cheaper than the other BB close by, which offers much better breakfast, service and room, and in which you do need to wait to use the bathroom. This BB in Cambridge has very thin wall, so you can always hear the noise from the busy street even at late night. In summary, I felt I lived in a hostel instead of a BB."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"I stayed in the BB in Cambridge from 9-14 August 2014 when I attended a course at Harvard. The biggest asset of this BB is the location: it is 10-min. walk to the Harvard Yard. The breakfast was also very good (crepes or flapjacks with blueberries), but could be more varied. Byron, the live-in manager was very helpful and entertaining. I booked this BB based on the very positive reviews, but the standard has obviously dropped since they were written. Having said that, the owners have been working on bringing it back to standard, especially the cleanliness. However, more work is needed to make it a competitive BB, suitable to the needs of business travellers or visitors to Harvard or MIT. It was also too expensive for what it offered (188 a night!) The bathroom is shared! If you are on a tight schedule you will need to book the shower. We had 5 people competing for the shower, but the biggest problem was the toilet (no guest WC). The back porch needs a lot of work before it can be enjoyed by the guests, but they do have a selection of books and Byron is a walking encyclopaedia of knowledge about Cambridge and Boston. Parking: you will need a lot of luck or a lot of patience! The apartment is on the third floor, so ask Byron for help with your luggage. Bottom line: Great location, and great potential. With honest work this can be a great place to stay for visitors to Harvard or MIT. I hope the owners will turn this BB around to deserve great reviews again."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Byron is a considerate and hard-working host. Breakfast is excellent. Room is over-priced. Location is good.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"The only reason that this doesn't get 5 stars is that it is way overpriced. With those rates, one would expect a fancy hotel, but this BB offers something quite different than that. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Location is great, with a 10 minute walk to Harvard Square, metro, and restaurants. With only three rooms, you actually... More"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"I spent a week staying at this B B for a work trip- and I'd strongly recommend it to others. IT's a beautiful old building, located in one of the most picturesque parts of Boston, and walking distance from great restaurants and Harvard Sq. The owners and the manager also really care about you having a good experience, and... More"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Decided to stay here on a personal trip to the area, but was quickly disappointed once I lugged my suitcase up the 3 stories of the building on a rather warm Boston day. Similar to other reviews, the website invited me to belief that I would be staying at a clean, charming, BB, with privacy and antiques, but rather I experienced dusty, musty, creaky, invasive, and somewhat haunting of an experience. I had planned to stay three nights, but left after the first night because I couldn't sleep (due to the lack of AIR CONDITIONING and lack of a fan), uncomfortable bed, and the notion that a creepy crawly might crawl over my face while sleeping or showering (yes, there is a plant in the shower.) I've stayed at several BBs in the past and had lovely experiences when the hosts provide a clean, comfortable room and bathroom situation, along with friendly (not invasive and pushy) service, but unfortunately, my experience here was none of that. Once the uncomfortable night was over, I gave a chance to the breakfast served by the Innkeeper, however alongside my crepe, fruit, and bananas (no protein or bread), I received a political and religious lecture to start off my morning as well. If you're looking for a story to tell, then I'd recommend staying here, but if you're looking for a comfortable, private, quiet place to rest your head in Cambridge, I'd stay elsewhere."

A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Building has no resemblance to Expedia photo but it is well situated for visitors to Harvard. CAUTION no parking near by. I would stay there again.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"I booked this BB based on the great reviews and got seriously disappointed. The standard has obviously dropped since those reviews were written.

A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Not an easy task to find a decent and affordable BB in Cambridge for a 1-week stay. This one is charmful but room is not so convenient: furniture is outdated and A/C quite noisy. Not adapted to business trip (didn't know where to put my luggage) but most likely perfect for backpackers. The innkeeper is very nice and talkative which is great. I did enjoy our morning chatting when he was preparing breakfast (invariably a stuffed crepe with home made fruit compote and valilla yogurt) and good filtered coffee.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,Le propritaire est charmant et nous a prpar des bons breakfasts . La chambre n'est pas trs grande et la baignoire est vetuste . part cela tout tait bien .
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,The host is very nice. The house is comfortable and peaceful. Many useful arrangements for travelers.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,A nice BnB in the Harvard University area. We were well taken care of by Byron the innkeeper who served lovely breakfast with good stories every morning.
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"I ran the Boston Marathon and stayed as a last minute booking to make up for an airbnb host cancellation. The BB provided a workable solution that allowed access to public transit to and from Boston. The host, Byron, was welcoming and very accommodating."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"The room was great, clean, and in excellent shape. The host was also fantastic - he was extremely interesting to talk to over breakfast and would always check and make sure every part of my stay was okay. In all, this was one of the best places I've ever stayed at, and highly recommended if you're visiting around the Harvard Square area. I will definitely try to stop by again if I'm ever around Cambridge again!"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Share bathroom with others. Kinda noisy. However, the staff will cook for you every morning. It's an awesome experience. 5 min walk from Harvard campus."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"Suddenly without a place to stay, I was fortunate enough to get a room at A B B in Cambridge. The guesthouse exceeded my expectation, to say the least. The staff is super friendly and serves guests delicious creps for breakfast! Everything is neat and clean my room was good and the kitchen a clean and cozy place. While I stayed, it was very warm in Boston (around 30C) but a controllable AC in my room made sure I felt good the whole time. The wi-fi is better than in most hotels I've stayed in, and the location is perfect - almost on the Harvard campus. I would definitely recommend the place to anybody looking for a friendly place to stay in Boston."
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"I stayed in this BB about a month ago. We booked it following great reviews, and the only thing I can say is that we were extremely disappointed. When we arrived at the address we were surprised at how shabby the house was. It looked like it hasnt been renovated since the Victorian times. The interior proved to be much... More"
A Bed & Breakfast In Cambridge,"This facility misrepresents itself in its advertisement. It claims to serve breakfast, but breakfast is a waffle served by the resident caretaker, Byron. He is an incredible host, very engaging in conversation, but really, I paid for breakfast but I did not get anything remotely resembling breakfast. The excuse is that the local Massachusetts Bay authority does not allow them... More"

What the owners lack on care for the property, Byron, the housekeeper, makes up in kindness: he keeps the place alive and well functioning, entertains with wonderful conversations, and cooks masterful breakfast."
