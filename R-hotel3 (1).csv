Hotel,Reviews
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Relaxing. Nice and peaceful.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Room could use upgrades. It is not walking distance to beach.better to pay the extra to stay closer to beach and restaurants.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The hotel was great for our stay. It was a couples trip for beach week. The only things I didn't like was the cleanliness of the bathroom. And as a women that's a big part of staying in the hotel
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Not a bad stay , hotel could use a remodel. .nice to have a 24 hr restaurant on premises. .pool was nice as well. .I'd book again"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Musty smelling bathroom. Continental breakfast was a joke. Bananas were edible.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Went to Virginia Beach to pick up our son from deployment. Checked into our hotel on Friday evening. Went to our room, which looked nice at first. Looked under the mattress only to find a bedbug. Manager tried to say it was a cockroach. They did offer to upgrade our room but I just wanted a refund. I only got refunded one night and lost my money for the second night. Definitely would not recommend staying there."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,overpriced/older/bed ok/fridge grimy iced/brkf ended too early for a Sat am
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"We atayed at the hotel from 7/3-7/6. The room was old, smelly, bathtub was broken, toilet seat was burned and the water presure was incosistent. Carpet was old and dirty. Room service came one time and just made our beds with all that was in our bed such as cheerios and baby's toys. They did not change our towels or clean the bathroom. Water in the pool was cold. Lot of noise around the pool did not make our stay relaxing. They charged 220 per night. It is such a shame to rip off hard working American people just bc they wanted to celebrate their most important holiday July 4th. This room is not worth 30. Would not recomend this hotel to anyone."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Refrigerators was rusted
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Got a headache every time I went to the room. I think mold is in the walls. There were bugs in our beds. I didn't stay the second night that we had paid for.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Enjoyed my stay I will stay again
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Would stay again
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"This was a true nightmare. The add stated it was oceanfront, it wasnt! the front door would not lock. It had gray duct on the lock section, which was painted it over. It appeared to be a place for squatters. It was not safe. The furniture was old, outdated and it smelled. And we couldn't get a refund!"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The Hotel staff were very friendly and accommodating. The rooms were fine. There was a mini fridge, microwave, hair dryer, and ironing board/iron. However the showers were awful. The water would get scalding hot and then ice cold. At first we thought it was because everyone was returning from the beach but it continued. The Hotel is in a great location-5 block walk to beach, boardwalk, restaurants, shops and entertainment. The pool was nice with not many people there. All in all experience was fine-I would probably return because the price was good and the only bad thing was the showers."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The door to our room was broke and didn't even shut and latch. We just pushed it open all the time. The guest service was disorganized at desk and not very friendly. The hotel needs a lot more maintanence.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"There is ample parking which is great because we would walk or ride our bikes to the beach everyday. We didn't move our car once. The bed was pretty comfortable and clean. The TV was nice and having a fridge and microwave was convenient. There were so many mirrors so there was no issue when getting ready. There was tons of counter space for toiletries inside and outside the bathroom. The bathroom needed and update and good cleaning, but nothing we couldn't handle. We actually booked another room to stay a night longer than expected and we were able to stay in the same room. It was a very easy process."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It suited us as needed a Simple accommodations with basic amenities. In process of renovation. Location was not ideal with no food or coffee had to drive to get one.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The front desk personnel were great. I will return. Since I work in the travel business, I would recommend."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The hotel charged additional fee for persons over 12 years old. The hotel did not provide facial tissues. The previous hotel guest left his watch in the room. He phoned back to ask us to look for the watch. When we found the watch, I informed the hotel staff and asked that they return the watch to the patron."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,WiFi did not work well the entire stay.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"I hate reading reviews online because the negative ones are usually from people who usually don't travel a lot and are used to 5 star hotels. This hotel is great for location to the convention center and the beach. My husband and I stayed one night for a dance competition at the convention center. Service was decent, room was clean, and we felt safe in the neighborhood. It's literally 60 seconds from the convention center, so the location was perfect. Would definitely stay here again."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was horrible the housekeeper was kept knocking on door after we asked her to clean the room after we left see goes to get manager he harassed us and threatened us cops were called it just was a mess rooms were smelly and hot i would not recommend this hotel to a dog
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,They had bed bugs badly
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Me and my boyfriend stayed at this hotel for two nights. I was hesitant at first from reading previous reviews.. but we had a delightful stay! We had a king size bed which was very comfortable. No issues checking in since we are 19. The room was clean, we got sick during our stay and threw up all over the bed and floor and room service had no problems cleaning everything up. Good distance from the beach.. not that close but a few blocks down. I would definitely stay here again."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The front staff was very professional and courteous. The cleanliness of the room could have been better, but overall not bad. The neighborhood during The day is great for walking. At night I would not go walking without my husband."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,I didn't mind it being out of date but the it not being clean and the insects was more than I could tolerate. The condition of one the beds was so bad it couldn't be slept in. Even before going to bed I canceled the rest of the reservation and couldn't wait to get out in the morning.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was not comfortable at all. Room smelled like smoke.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Not a quick walk to the beach, but clean and spacious room. Hotel very strict on their no cancellation policy if you choose that option. They did offer to look for something we left in the room and called us back with a response."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"All the staff was very friendly and the room was nicely cleaned every day with fresh towels, etc. The staff found my wife's gold earring while cleaning and placed it clearly on a table that we found on our return. Also, great, clean pool."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Last min booking, it was hard to get the water hot. And when you did shower the rug in the room would get wet."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The room was clean, that's the best I can say about it. The hotel is older and pretty shabby, absolutely plain, no decoration, no prettying up anywhere. Just very basic, very plain, not especially nice but not horrible. Overpriced, considering the bare-ness of the whole place."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,they wouldn't except my service dog so I didn't stay. I got a cheaper price right on the beach. but other than that this hotel was a roach infested dump I wouldn't have stayed there even if they excepted my service animal.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Good hotel for the price. Convenient location. Short walk to the beach and boardwalk. Friendly, accommodating and helpful staff."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Nothing special, but it was clean, comfortable and about 5 blocks from the boardwalk in a quieter, residential area. I would stay there again. My only interaction with staff was check in and check out, but they were friendly and extremely accommodating."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Very peaceful and enjoyable. Wonderful access to the places that I needed to be. The front desk clerks were very helpful.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was pretty good except for house keeping people kept peeping through my window 3-4 times
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Unless you have no other option don't do it. I gave them four points for cleanness. Other than that everything one star only.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,I was very disappointed when I saw that my room had roaches. They eventually switched me to a deluxe room which was the same room but in front of the pool. That room had a stuffed up shower and the curtains were falling off the window. There were lemon slices under my bed and next to the TV. They eventually got someone to uclog the shower but the experience was not good. It was a smoke free room but you could smell cigarettes from the staff walking around smoking all the time. The hotel was cheap and close to the beach but not worth the hassle. I would not recommend anyone to stay here.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was terrible!!! They did housekeeping but never did change the sheets. The shower was a mess and had standing water because the drain for it to escape wasnt working properly.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"This was a great stay for the conference I was attending around the corner at the convention center. Room was clean and a great place to stay, especially for the price."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"we didn't stay , terrible location"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The room was decent. We were close to the beach without having to deal with all the noise of the beach. There was nothing spectacular about the room but it wasn't dirty and that's what I was most concerned about. It's very much a you get what you pay for situation.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The rooms were clean but the outside was not cleaned on a regular basis.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,We were there for one night. Great location for the convention center- and 3-4 blocks from the beach. I think it's right beside a firehouse- made for an interesting Saturday night! Clean comfortable room.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"I chose this hotel because of price and walking distance to the convention center. The beach would not have been a far walk but I was here for business. I travel a lot and this was a quality room for the price. There is a lot of traffic in the area, being a tourist spot, so you hear that in the evening but it was quiet at night. I never tried the restaurant that is connected to the lobby. I would definitely stay here again."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"For the price the room could have been cleaner. The room also looked like a 12 year old painted it. The shower burnt both of us because the water was so hot and there was only three temps hot, warm and cold."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Very loud with countless military fighter jets flying overhead. But cool to watch none the less.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Full of cockroach. Smelly carpet. Super expensive for the hotel.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The room had a horrible smell to it and the door was so hard to open and close, the restaurant was not really a restaurant, the seafood platter had four shrimps that were smaller than my pinky fingernails, the four scallops were as small as the shrimps and they were burnt and hard"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was great
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Pros: Inexpensive accommodations, clean, courteous staff, location for Convention Center, short walk to eating establishments, free wifi Cons: Free Breakfast is only in summer (not indicated on website), shower had little water coming out, wifi signal was weak"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"No issues, got what i paid for i guess, not a 5 or 4 star hotel to say the least, but to my surprise the rooms was pretty clean and customer service was good. Its located 5 blocks from the boardwalk and you definitely can walk from the hotel. I would definitely not go there again unless i had to because of booking, however the staff and my stay was decent for a one night stay,"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,ROOMS WAS VERY DIRTY. HAD TWO ROOMS THE ROOMS WAS KIDS STAYED IN HAD BEDBUGS. NASTY
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Delightful stay, helpful and friendly staff, walking distance from beach and affordable! Also excellent restaurant."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The front desk staff were awesome and so friendly. Hotel was so-so but what I expected for the price. Walking distance to beach and almost right next door to the VA beach convention center so we were satisfied.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"I requested a king bed, which were available but ended up in room with 2 double beds."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Traveling by myself, I did not feel comfortable walking around by myself. The neighborhood didn't feel safe. It's not the hotel's fault, just an opinion I felt important to share."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Room 222 appeared newly painted. Linens were clean and comfy. Pillows were fresh. Towels could be upgraded. Refrigerator and microwave in working condition. Large granite countertop adjacent to bathroom gave additional space. Bathroom counter top was spotless. Sink was deep and had more water pressure than shower. Clean outside pool. Easy to locate. Within walking distance of food/events. Front desk personnel friendly and helpful.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Our stay was OK. Kind of what we expected for the money. Not amazing but not horrible. No elevator so we had to trek up two flights of stairs - that was the worst part. Other than that, decent place."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The staff was very friendly and our room was clean. Perfect size and location for a getaway.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,is a good service and good for family
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was okay .
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Clean.Reasonably priced.Still not to far from the beach.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Having a wedding!!!
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,This was disgusting. I didn't even stay and was still charged
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The staff was friendly and helpful, the room needed alot of improvement. Broken bathroom door and dirty carpet."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,I paid over 200 a night to stay at this motel. It is not a hotel and should be classified as such. It should have been priced no more than 75 a day. It looks old and run down and it was totally out of my style. The pictures on the Internet to advertise must be fake as it's not what you get.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,I have to say this was the worse experience I have ever had at a hotel. Upon arrival there was 3 people in front of us in line. All 3 people were there to complain and to ask for their money back. There was 2 people wanting their money refunded due to bed bugs that they had found in their room and another asking for a refund because the hotel was unable to give them the accommodations that were promised. The man at front desk was very argumentative and rude. When it was our turn we immediately explained that we were a little nervous to stay based on what we just witnessed. His logic was we might as well stay here because he was not going to give our money back and in addition to that he was insisting that we pay him 20 in cash because our child is 15 and anyone over 14 must pay additional charge. I again explained that we was just worried about bed bugs and he said that it was fine because he had called exterminator and thus had done everything he could. He was unreasonable and rude. I left the lobby in tears. We decided to inspect the room and found items that had been left there from the previous customers all over the room. In my opinion anyone considering this hotel for your vacation should just keep looking.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,One night stay. Great price and close to the beach for the music festival only there to sleep. Room had been updated a little but microwave dirty and pet hair in the floor
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The room was dirty--cob webs in corners, dust on lamps, furniture, headboards and base boards. The mini fridge had food in freezer and was dirty, so was the microwave. The windows were smeared and looked horrible. The fluorescent bulb above the vanity was missing and the desk lamp did not have a bulb. The front desk remedied some of it, but did not offer a discount or a free night's stay. Don't stay here unless it is your only choice!"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Bring vodka!
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"NOT REALIZING IT BUT THE HOTEL IS UNDER RENOVATION. OUTSIDE ALL YOU SEE ARE OLD MATTRESSES IN DUMPSTERS, TRASH ALL AROUND. THERE ARE ONLY A FEW ROOMS AVAILABLE MAINLY ON THE FIRST FLOOR. THE ROOM WAS FRESHLY PAINTED IT LOOKED DECENT BUT IT SMELLED OF MOLD AND MUST I SPRAYED IT WITH FEBREEZE BUT TO NO AVAIL IT DIDN'T HELP. TOILET FLUSHES VERY LOUD. BEDS WERE MODERATELY COMFORTABLE BUT HAD NO BLANKETS."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Worst hotel I have ever stayed at. I paid for 3 nights, left after first night. Dead spider in my bathroom, the room was gross."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Horrible experience the room smell old the bathroom in not good condition the power when off. Room service didn't clean everyday
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Everything was cool....room was nice,clean, pool was good.....cons... don't like how they don't let u know when they are coming to change towels and make ur bed....I left to go to the store and come back and they were n my room....nun of my belongings were tampered with when I checked jus was unexpected"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Excellent customer service.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"quick check in they, let us use their parking 4 hours prior to check in."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"It's nice because is close to the beach, but it's a little old need to upgrade bathrooms"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The staff was very friendly but the room was very outdated and for the price I paid It would have been nice to have more. the toilet was not attached to the floor and while I was away on my first day there it flooded. The staff moved us to a nicer/remodeled room but the hassle and the invasion of coming back to your room that you left a do no disturb on, having the curtains open to the whole world and the lights left on was a little unsettling."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Booked it online last min The pictures online are very deceiving when you book last minute you can't get a refund or we would have this place was dirty filthy smell like mildew and mold was noisy I have nothing good to say about it
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,This hotel is ready for an update. Longer walk to the beach than expected.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Nice hotel with friendly staff
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,I arrived late at night. The person at the front desk was very friendly and checked me in very quickly. The room a little wear and tear but was clean. I was only in the room the sleep so I was not looking for anything expensive or luxury. The bed was queen size and comfortable which was important. We were at the outer edge of a hurricane but I felt comfortable in the room during the extreme wind and rain. My car was safe the parking lot did not flood.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Horrible place to stay...never again
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Hotel was OK. I'm used to staying in MUCH nicer hotels, but for a somewhat last minute trip and wanting to be close to the beach and center of town its what We settled for. The pool was decent and I think it was heated at night. The room was not the best, it was somewhere to sleep and put our stuff, is what it was. Nothing fancy or extra AT ALL. the sheets had a hole and they were not changed everyday. And there wasn't even an actual comforter on the bed. We had to febreeze it( it had a stale smell) and I wiped down the room myself when we got there.( for my own assurance) But we still stayed for 4 nights 5 days. We went to target,radio shack, a little grocery shopping and the mall (with Dave and busters) ect. and the furthest we ever drove was still less then 10 mins. And the beach and broad walk was a half a mile down the street. I personally would never choose to stay here again but it wasn't the worst either. Like I said it was somewhere to stay and so affordable (under our normal hotel budget) and location wise, it was great, we were in the middle of everything. We'll just say it wasn't nearly bad enough to get in the way of enjoying our vacation."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"RUN!!!  Very run down, rooms smell, breakfast is the worst of any hotel I've stayed at.   Will never stay here again!"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"The stay was good.I enjoyed the environment,quiet and relaxing."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,enjoyed the stay
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Allow pets!
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Great price for value. The a/c was cranking when we got to our room. This continued for the duration of the week, and since it was high in the 90's, made for a comfortable night's sleep. The pillows and linens were very snuggly and soft. It felt safe to stay there all by myself. It was a few blocks further away from the beach than I expected. I'm glad I upgraded to the room with the refrigerator."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,absolutely nothing upscale about this hotel but a comfortable place to stay. not too far away from the beach and an easy location to the highway.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"I reserved this room for two days because Its close to the starting line of VA beach rock and roll half marathon. Hotel charged me about 250 per night. It's about 20 min walk to the beach, breakfast was bad, bed is not comfortable, AC was loud. I really regret paying price of 5 stars hotel and getting worst service."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Considering how much they charged us, the room was in poor shape, needs a lot of work to bring it up to par."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Great front desk staff. Clean rooms. The do a great job of keeping pool clean
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Overpriced for the quality and location. It was Labor Day weekend so I expected to pay more but, paying over 300/night for a room that was worth a third of that was hard to swallow. If the price was right during a normal weekend, I'd consider staying there again. Rooms need an upgrade."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Needs some tlc. It was a good room for a great price. It was only for one night and to be honest wouldn't do it again.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Very happy with hotel. Clean and friendly staff. Helpful. Rooms nice and cleaned great every day. The only fault was it is 7 blocks from beach but for the price that was okay. Would stay there again and may next year if we go back.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Poor cancellation policy, governor of VA declared state of emergency and asked people not to travel, still had to pay for room"
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"i would not stay at the ambassador suite gain. We only stayed because most of the other hotels we booked. when we got there the face sink had dirt in it and there was alot of soap builtup and the vanity counter was dirty with hairs i called hotel.com to leave because i didn't feel comfortable staying there, i waited on the line and hotel.com told me that the hotel says they would have to charge me for two nights stay if we choose to leave. I would definately not dear to stay at this again."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,It was scary. Dirty seems like a motel where people live. Their where drunks and smell like urine I only stayed one night although I reserve it for two. My kids where scared my mom and myself took shifts on sleeping and I still didn't sleep
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,"Our room was very clean.... a little out dated. We stayed in room 121 The king bed was not very comfortable. The hotel is 5 bocks from beach,but it is in a very nice and quite location. The gentleman that checked us in was very nice.Our TV remote did not work and he was quick to get us a replacement."
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,Room was clean. No body towel. Have to call for it after got out of the shower.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,check in was easy. parking lot was well lit. grounds were well maintained. I missed having a coffee maker in the room. My door wouldnt latch shut unless the deadbolt was used. I appreciate a clean motel that is pet friendly.
Ambassadors Inn and Suites,The Hotel is in a great location. Right across from the Convention Ctr. and near Virginia Beach. Ample parking and a great swimming pool.
